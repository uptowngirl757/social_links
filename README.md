## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I tried not setting a height on my container. i actually saw this tip reading someone else's solution code on the QRcode challenge and I decided to try it. It worked! and it made my life way easier as I did'nt have to deal with overflow or anything like that in my page.

### Continued development

I would need to work on a deeper understanding of flexbox and how to use it right

Bradley Tim from the Frontend mentor. I read his CSS code on the QRcode component challenge and decided to try not setting a min-height. It was a good idea. Thanks!
